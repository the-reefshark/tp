## Project: KanBug Tracker

### Overview

This portfolio page highlights my contributions to KanBug Tracker - a Software Engineering project developed as part of the module CS2103T during my second year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore. 

### About the Team

We are five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates reading CS2103T: Software Engineering. 

### About the project

KanBug Tracker is a lightweight, easy to use bug management tool that aims to empower developers to keep better track of the bugs in their projects. It provides users not only with a convenient way to record their bugs, but also allows them to better coordinate their efforts between various bugs and track the state of each bug throughout its lifecycle. The team has also developed various other user-centric features to provide our users with the functionality they need to empower their bug tracking efforts. 

## Summary of contributions

**As the project is on going, this section will be filled up at a later time.**

* **New Feature**: I implemented the ability to add tags to an already existing bug via the `addTag` command.
  
  * What it does: The feature provides the user with the ability to quickly select a target bug and add any number of tags to that bug.
  * Justification: The feature improves KanBug Tracker significantly because users now have a quick and direct method to add more tags to an already existing bug. Without this feature, users will be forced to make use of the existing `edit` command which requires users to retype all of the bug's existing tags in addition to the tags they would now like to add. This saves the user valuable time, helping them improve their productivity and efficiency. 
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires and in-depth understanding of the Logic component's architecture and how the different components within it interact and function. 
  
* **New Feature**: I implemented the ability to edit tags of an already existing bug via the `editTag` command.

  * What it does: The feature provides the user with the ability to quickly select a target bug and modify one of its tags.
  * Justification: The feature improves KanBug Tracker significantly because users now have a quick and direct method to update an existing tag of the bug. Without this feature, users will be forced to make use of the existing `edit` command which requires users to retype all of the bug's existing tags in addition to the newly modified tag. This saves the user valuable time, helping them improve their productivity and efficiency.

* **Other contributions:**
  
  * **Project management**: 
    * As the in-charge of Deadlines and Deliverables, I monitored and coordinated the efforts between the various team members to ensure that the team worked cohesively and were putting in consistent effort. 
    * Set up GitHub team organization, repository and GitHub pages.
    * Set up Continuous Integration actions on team repository and added branch protection to ensure that code contributions would be of high standard.
    * Contributed to product ideation, brainstorming user stories and key features, and ensuring that everyone had an equal share of assigned tasks. 
    * Created meeting agendas for weekly team meeting to ensure that the team was always on task and that each individual was making progress on their assigned tasks. 
  * **Team Documentation:**
    * Wrote the sections for the Introduction, Getting Started, Glossary, `editTag` and `addTag` commands in KanBug Tracker's User Guide.
    * Wrote the sections for Edit Tag and Add Tag features in the Developer Guide.
  * **Beyond the team**:
    * Peer testing and bug reporting:
